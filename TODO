- port of SSA translation:
    SSA translation takes as input a table of blocks where the block type is
    inside the disasm module and should be transformed to a new block type
    for ssa form
    
    To get the control flow graph, lib/bap_disasm/bap_disasm_symtab.mli 
    has to_graph that takes a symbol table and a block table and 
    construct a call graph.
